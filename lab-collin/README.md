### Documentation
In your README.md file, describe the exported values of each module defined in your `lib` directory. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and the expected output behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to include any additional information that you would like.
