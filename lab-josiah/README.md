## Overview

This program consists of modules which are exported and tested.

## Architecture

Greet.js exports an object that contains one function. That function takes in a single parameter. User can input a word and the function returns 'hello' + word.
arithmetic.js exports an object that contains two functions. Each function takes in two parameters. The first function adds both numbers, and the second function subtracts both numbers. If either functions parameters are not numbers then null is returned.
