In greet.js the export that we are using is exporting a function with a single string parameter, the expected output is a concatenated string with the input of the string parameter. 

In arithmetic.js we are exporting 2 functions that are similar and expect 2 inputs each of integers. The expected output of the add function is the addition of the 2 input integers as a sum. The sub function functions as a subtracting function where the 2nd input is subtracted from the first parameter.
